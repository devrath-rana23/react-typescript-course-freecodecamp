//this is normal typescript file so extension is .ts not .tsx

// The . ts file extension is used when you are creating functions, classes, reducers, etc. that do not require the use of JSX syntax and elements, whereas the . tsx file extension is used when you create a React component and use JSX elements and syntax.

export interface Todo {
    id: number;
    todo: string;
    isDone: boolean;
  }
